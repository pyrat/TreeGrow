h1. TreeGrow

A wee javascript tree implementation which relies on Jquery. This is not yet a plugin and may not be featured enough for what you need.

This relies on some complex view rendering to get the correct html which the javascript hooks into. Will hopefully provide example rails / php helpers for this in the future.
